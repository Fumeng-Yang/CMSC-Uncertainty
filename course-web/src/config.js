These topics will be pursued through independent reading, assignments, and class discussion. The seminar comprises four assignments that not just apply HCI research methods but push the envelope of what has been done before. The assignments are designed to be meaningful and potentially discover something new in the field, and students will also attend HCI faculty candidate talks this semester as part of this course. We will have readings that teach HCI methods and provide examples of research contributions, sometimes alongside the reviews of those papers as they were evaluated for publication.

Learn HCI/VIS research topics (reading papers); extend them a bit (doing homeworks H1-3); get a bite on the peer-reviewing process (experiencing submitting-review-revise H4-5); improve presentation skills (doing presentations)

// The goal of this course is to provide students with the background necessary to perform research in HCI and the skills required to conduct human-centric research. Students who take this course should have a particular interest in HCI research, or wish to learn fundamental skills that will help them with a user interface design or usability evaluation career. There will be little or no content in this course about interface design, but students will find other topics in CSCI 1300 (User Interfaces) relevant. Enthusiastic students who have not taken CSCI 1300 should have independently gained HCI experience or be a graduate student studying a related topic, and be able to manipulate software and data to investigate the research questions posed in class.`
